## Project Proposal

### Overview

The paper discusses my proposal on building a simple game using construct 2. I want to build a game using a platform where a simple game can be built with the knowledge of HTML5. Construct2 can be used to build a 2D game. The game that I want to build is very simple and basic and yet very engaging. I want to build a game that can be enjoyed by any age group and there is no violence shown in the game. In this game the idea will be to cut vegetables and gain points. The difficulty of the game and the rewards will increase as you go to the next level.

### Motivation

This project will be interesting as it caters to all age groups and there is no violence in the game. I have always wanted to build a game that is free of any form of violence and is able to cater to all age groups. While growing up, I came across candy crush and since then I wanted to build a game that captures the attention of players and rewards them like that. So, the game will be inspired by candy crush. 

### Description

The game will give people similar satisfaction that they get while watching satisfactory videos. This game will allow people to choose their vegetables and the knife size and the different shapes option as well. People will be able to change the background and their kitchen as well. In higher levels they have to cut the vegetables while walking and running. 

Understanding and working with Construct2 is easier as it helps in creating the game by dragging and dropping entities. The perfect slices are needed to be cut in a few levels and as the level is increased multiple features are added. Players can compete with each other and can connect to other players online. 

They can play individually as well as in teams and can send messages as well. This will increase the interaction of players and can increase the engagement of players with the game as well. The trick here will be players will have to avoid fruits while cutting the vegetables and it would be a close call in higher levels. 

In higher levels, if a player cuts vegetables by mistake, they would be penalised more and would lose points on that. Players would also need to worry about avoiding water balloons in between and need to be careful while cutting the vegetables. 

In levels after 15, players can cook meals with the vegetables they had cut, so the nature of the game will improve in higher levels and players will have something to look forward to. There will be surprise rewards and players will not know what to expect in higher levels. This will build the enthusiasm in players to return and play the game. The game will be interactive with sound effects and background music so that players are engaged.

       This game will thus test the players reflex as a vegetable cut game demands patience, active reflexes, a lot of focus and strategy in order to win the game and move onto the next level. Many types of vegetables such as potatoes, tomatoes, carrot, cabbage, cauliflower will be floating on a cutting board, coming towards players. 
       
       Players  should tap on the screen as quickly as they can to chop the vegetables while also avoiding fruits and fire crackers at the same time. The players will need to fill the cooking pan to complete the level and move on to the next one. The Satisfying cut vegetable games will thus offer interactive user controls.
       
    This game will thus be all about working on vegetable cutting skills and hitting the target with accuracy. Filling the vegetable basket with cut vegetables to score more and more points, cutting all veggies while avoiding cutting the obstacles. The endless veggie slasher mania levels will thus keep players engaged. In order to play this game, players will need to download the game and they can launch it by tapping on the play icon.


### Technologies

In order to build this game I will be using the latest version of game building tool Construct 2 to help me build my 2D version of the game. It is a simple and effective tool that does not require extreme coding and can be used if a person has a knowledge of HTML5. The tool is helpful in building a smooth game and addons can be added smoothly that can enhance the features of the game. Once this tool is downloaded, it can work even when there is no internet connection. With the help of this tool, the game can be published to iOS and Android on all other major platforms. 

### Skills Required

The major skill that is needed to use construct 2 is basic HTML5. Apart from this a basic idea about how to use the gaming tool will do. A clarity on how to build the game and what features should be there on different levels is needed to build a smooth experience for users. The game entities can be placed by simply dragging and dropping in the various levels followed by addition of respective events and behaviours. The few concepts are simplified for construct2 and it makes the job easier. The basic IT skills and knowledge of HTLM5 will do. It will use simple UI/UX design.

### Outcome

If the project is successful, people will be able to download the game from the play store and enjoy playing the game in their leisure time. My main aim was to give children and adults a game where there is no violence and the game should not be very addictive. So, this game solves both the purpose. Once this game is developed, it can give people a sense of satisfaction and kids can enjoy this game while not being addicted to the game. So, it ensures safety as well because parents would not need to worry about kids getting exposed to violence in games.
